   #### 3:1  overview of election audit
    The purpose of this election audit analysis: 
    The Colorado Board election employee has given us the following task to complete the election audit of the recent localcongressional election to 
    calculate the number of votes cast, complete lists of candidates who received votes, the total number of votes each candidate received, 
    percentage of votes each candidate won andthe winner of the election.Election audit those verified election results and ensure voting machine 
    functioned properly. For this audit purpose, we want to go over the steps required in detail. showing you a technique commonly used by programmers to 
    write steps of their code, which is called pseudocode. Pseudocode will make the audit easier to
    present to non-technical colleagues and stakeholders.

   #### 3:3 Election audit Summary
		
       The election auditâ€™s purpose is to determine whether the votes were counted properly, or the proper procedure was followed for the election. 
    We want to show a technique commonly used by programmers to write steps of their code, which is called pseudocode. The statements of the proposal
    script are used to analyze an election in a short time, provide accurate data, and save a lot of time and can be modified by adding election 
    program cost to better control the cost.
